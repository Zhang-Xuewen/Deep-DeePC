## I. How to use

### 1. Install required packages:
```
    pip install -r path/to/requirements.txt
```
Note: if you want to use `GPU`, please install GPU version of `torch`, e.g.:
```
    pip install torch==1.8.0+cu101 torchvision==0.9.0+cu101 torchaudio===0.8.0 -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/torch_stable.html
```

The source code can automatically run on a `CPU` or `GPU` without any modification.

- Specifically, two toolboxes are used which are developed by myself [`deepctools`](https://github.com/QiYuan-Zhang/DeePCtools) and [`QYtool`](https://github.com/QiYuan-Zhang/QYtool) for research purposes.

### 2. Run the project

- The arguments of DDeePC project is defined and modified in `ddeepc_args.py`, specify the arguments first.
- The training and testing part is in `main.py`.
  
#### a. Generate set-points for selected system:

```
    python main.py --system (selected systems) --gen_sp (number of set-points) --N (Time steps for one set-point)
```
For example:
```
    python main.py --system threetanks --gen_sp 10 --N 100
```

- Figure of generating set-points:
![gen_sp](./_data/README_fig/gen_sp.png)


#### b. Train and test the model:
```
    python main.py --system (selected systems) --train --test_num (number of test runs) --N (Time steps for one set-point) --noise (#if add it, apply noise)
```
After training finished, it will automatically test the model.

For example:
```
    python main.py --system threetanks --train --test_num 1 --N 100 --noise
```

- The training process will automatically generate a new folder with a new trial number and save all related data and figures in this path: `./_results/system/new trial number`.

- First test the conventional DeePC performance based on current parameters:
  
![train_1](./_data/README_fig/train_1.png)

- Next start the training process:

![train_2](./_data/README_fig/train_2.png)
![train_3](./_data/README_fig/train_3.png)

- After training, start the test process for Deep DeePC and constrained Deep DeePC:

![train_2](./_data/README_fig/test_1.png)
![train_2](./_data/README_fig/test_1.png)



#### c. Test the well-trained model:
```
    python main.py --system (selected systems) --test (model number) --test_num (number of test runs) --N (Time steps for one set-point) --noise (#if add it, apply noise)
```
For example, to test the well-trained model 3:
```
    python main.py --system threetanks --test 3 --test_num 10 --N 100 --noise
```
- The test part is identical to the part used in training and can be used for multiple evaluation trials.

Additionally, two toolboxes are used which are developed by myself:

- [`deepctools`](https://github.com/QiYuan-Zhang/DeePCtools): A wrapped package for Data-enabled predictive control (DeePC) implementation. Including DeePC and Robust DeePC design with multiple objective functions.
- [`QYtool`](https://github.com/QiYuan-Zhang/QYtool): A wrapped useful tool package designed for research purposes, tailored specifically for my own research needs.


## III. Introduction to Deep DeePC


### 1. Training data construction

![Data_process](./_data/README_fig/Data_process.svg)

Figure from our paper [**Deep DeePC: Data-enabled predictive control with low or no online optimization using deep learning**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16338). Please refer to the paper for more details.


### 2. Offline training 

![Architecture](./_data/README_fig/Architecture.svg)

Figure from our paper [**Deep DeePC: Data-enabled predictive control with low or no online optimization using deep learning**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16338). Please refer to the paper for more details.

- Neural network: $\hat{g} = F_{\theta}(\bm{u}_{ini},\bm{y}_{ini}, e_u, e_y \mid \theta)$


- Objective function: $J = \mathbb{E}_{\mathcal{D}} \Vert \mathbf{y}^r - \hat{\mathbf{y}} \Vert_Q^2 + \Vert \mathbf{u}^r - \hat{\mathbf{u}} \Vert_R^2 + \omega (\mathbf{u}, \mathbf{y})$ 



### 3. Constrainted Deep DeePC for online implementation

![Constraint_handling](./_data/README_fig/Constraint_handling.svg)

Figure from our paper [**Deep DeePC: Data-enabled predictive control with low or no online optimization using deep learning**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16338). Please refer to the paper for more details.

- When predicted trajectories $\hat{\mathbf{u}}_k = U_f \hat{g}_k, \ \hat{\mathbf{y}}_k = Y_f \hat{g}_k$ violate constraints, solve the following optimization problem:

$$\min_{g^{\*}_k} \Vert g^{\*}_k - \hat{g}_k \Vert_2^2$$

s.t.  $$\mathbf{u}_{lb} \leq U_f g^{\*}_k \leq \mathbf{u}_{ub}$$

$$\mathbf{y}_{lb} \leq Y_f g^{\*}_k \leq \mathbf{y}_{ub}$$




- Then apply the new operator $g^*_k$ to obtain the optimal control action to the system.
